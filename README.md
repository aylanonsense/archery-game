============

A simple archery game I'm using to hone my WebGL skills.

Goals
-----
The game will have a character that can move with WASD or the arrow keys. If the player clicks the character they can drag to aim an arrow in the opposite direction. When the mouse button is released, the arrow is fired. The player attempts to shoot at targets.
